# OpinionMining

The goal is to summarise, compare, and recommend (with explanations) products based on features and associated sentiment mined from product reviews.

* Provided with a dataset of (6,000) reviews for two product domains (digital cameras and printers) 
* Opinion mining – extract product features (feature sets are provided) and associated sentiment from the product reviews for each product

Functionality:
1. Product summary – the table on previous slide represents the basic deliverable for 
this task, top marks going for novel/interesting product summaries. 
2. Product comparison – compare two or more products based on common/distinct 
features & associated sentiment. 
3. Product recommendation and explanations – for a given (target) product, provide 
recommendations of similar products to the target product. Provide explanations 
for each recommendations made – e.g. recommendation X has better sentiment 
for features A, B, and C compared to current product…
